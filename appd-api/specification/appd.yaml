  Application:
    description: |
      Defines an application retrieved from an FDC3 App Directory, which can then be launched.
      Launching typically means running for a user on a desktop, but the concepts around laucnhing including
      who or what might do it, and how the launch action is initiated are discussed elsewhere in the FDC3 App Directory spec.
    required:
      - appId
      - name
      - appType
      - appDetails
    properties:
      appId:
        type: string
        description: |
          The unique application identifier within located within a specific applicationd directory instance.

      name:
        type: string
        description: |
          The name of the application.
          The name should be unique within an FDC3 App Directory instance. The exception to the uniqueness constraint is that an App Directory can hold definitions for
          multiple versions of the same app.
          The same appName could occur in other directories. We are not currently specifying app name conventions in the document.

      appType:
        type: string
        description: |
          The type of the application. There should be predefined values, the different application types would also have different data fields.
          Custom values will also be allowed to enable the use of in-house or 3rd party specific values such as layouts to be specified.
          Launchers are expected to ignore applications of a custom type that they do not support.
          The standard values proposed are
          - DesktopExe. Some executable on the desktop. The detailed definitions could allow for Windows and Mac. This would mainly be used for specifying in-house applications
          developed using .Net.
          - Container. A Web Application detined to run in a container. The Container application type coud include meta data for the various container types that an
          application vendor may support.
          - Custom.{Vendor}.{CustomAppType}. Additional private application types can be specified. It reuqires co-ordination between the  launcher and the App Directory instances to
          allow these values to be used. An example would be to allow Desktop Layouts to be specified in an in-house App Directory Instance

      version:
        type: string
        description: Version of the application. This allows multiple app versions to be defined using the same app name. This can be a triplet but can also include things like 1.2.5 (BETA)

      intents:
        type: array
        description: |
          The list of intents implemented by the Application.

          NB The usage and meaning of Intents is still under discussion in the Intent WG (as of 27-Jun-18). See the comment on '#/definitions/Intent' for details.
          I think the essence of the 'debate' is around how closely the terminology should match that used in Android.
          I believe that in Android this intents field (within the Application definition) would be called actions and would effectively hold an Intent name and a Context,
          where a context is an object type like Contact or Symbol.Equity that serves as a restriction on where the Intent/Action is valid.
          However the current Intent definition can hold a Context so the split between action and intent is not strictly necessary.

          We would recommend that Manifests can reference this URL via macros
      signature:
        type: string
        description: The domain or public key that the application lives under. For example, the manifest_url would not be able to live under cdn.openfin2.co. Public Key would be a 1:1 ratio to an application but you can have many applications under a domain. Only required if app type is container.
      manifests:
        type: array
        description: |
          List of Container specific manifests for the application.
          Maybe allow a short cut to just have a single manifest for sites with only a single container.
          The discriminated list is of more use for companies offering an application supported in multiple containers.
